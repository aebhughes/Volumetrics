Volumetrics
===========

Import library for the logistics industry in Python.

If you ever had to create software for the courier industry, you would immediately recognise the difficulty of Volumetrics.

Volumetrics is a formula that is used throughout the courier industry. Imagine the item to be shipped is in a square box (assuming it is not in a real box). Measure the Length, Width and height in centimeters, multiply these measurements together and divide by 5000. (Sometimes 6000, if the courier company is generous).

The resulting figure resents the weight Kilograms, assuming the items is of 'average' weight in relation to it's size. The greater of the volumetric weight and the actual weight is deemed the chargable weight.

Thus, a block of polystrene, for example, may only wiegh 500 grams, but the chargable weight may be 10 Kgs - because of the amount of space it will comsume in the cargo hold.
